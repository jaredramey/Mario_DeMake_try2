Notes on Super Space Butts:

General:
	- Enemies
		-> Fly enemy needs hitbox update to actually make him a threat
	
	- User Interface
		-> Add suicide Button
		-> Add quite level key (escape)

On level one:
	- Redo level start
		-> Might just redo the entire level

	- Weird wall glitch on starting wall before hole


Boss:
	- Fix camera
		-> Show whole boss level and not just a fraction of it

	- Give better visual que
		-> Would still like to do something w/ lighting effects
